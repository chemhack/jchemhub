To get started, you need a copy of closure library under the git root. 

	svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/ closure

If you already have the library, just link it. 

	ln -s -d /usr/lib/closure-library/closure/ closure2
	
	On Windows, use command below.
	
	mklink /D closure D:\closure-library\closure

NOTE: DO NOT add closure library to git repository. The library has more than 3000 files.
